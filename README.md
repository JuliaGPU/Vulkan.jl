High-level interface to Vulkan, using [VulkanCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/VulkanCore.jl). It uses the [Vulkan XML Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/) to catch common API uses and expose wrappers around them. It leads to improved stability and ease of use, while introducing as small a overhead as possible.
