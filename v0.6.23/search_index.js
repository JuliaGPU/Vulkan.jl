It exposes abstractions over the underlying C interface, primarily geared towards developers looking for a more natural way to work with Vulkan with minimal overhead.\n\nIt builds upon the core API provided by VulkanCore.jl. Because Vulkan is originally a C specification, interfacing with it requires some knowledge before correctly being used from Julia. This package acts as an abstraction layer, so that you don't need to know how to properly call a C library, while still retaining full functionality. The wrapper is generated directly from the Vulkan Specification.\n\nThis is a very similar approach to that taken by VulkanHpp, except that the target language is Julia and not C++.\n\nIf you have questions, want to brainstorm ideas or simply want to share cool things you do with Vulkan don't hesitate to create a thread in our Zulip channel.\n\nStatus\n\nThis package is a work in progress and has not reached its 1.0 version yet. As such, documentation may not be complete and functionality may change without warning. If it happens, make sure to check out the changelog. At this stage, you should not use this library in production; however, you are encouraged to push its boundaries through non-critical projects. If you find limitations, bugs or want to suggest potential improvements, do not hesitate to submit issues or pull requests. The goal is definitely to be production-ready as soon as possible.\n\nIn particular, because the library relies on automatic code generation, there may be portions of the Vulkan API that are not wrapped correctly. While you should not have trouble in most cases, there are always edge cases which were not accounted for during generation. Please open an issue whenever you encounter such a case, so that we can reliably fix those wrapping issues for future use.\n\nTesting\n\nCurrently, continuous integration runs only on Ubuntu 32/64 bits, for lack of a functional CI setup with Vulkan for MacOS and Windows. Because public CI services lack proper driver support, the CPU Vulkan implementation Lavapipe is used. If you are not on Linux, we cannot guarantee that this library will work for you, although so far nothing is platform-dependent. If that is the case, we recommend that you test this package with your own setup.\n\nDepends

from the spec:\n\nDepth/stencil formats are considered opaque and need not be stored in the exact number of bits per texel or component ordering indicated by the format enum.\n\nThis means we can't reliably interpret an image with a depth/stencil format. The image needs to be transitioned to a color format first (e.g. D16 to R16), and when both depth and stencil aspects are present, a view must be formed for the transfer (e.g. D16S8 must be viewed with the depth aspect for transfer from D16 into R16, or with the stencil aspect for transfer from S8 into R8).\n\nThe exact byte representation is available at https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap49.html#texel-block-size.\n\nNote from the spec for packed representations:\n\nPacked formats store multiple components within one underlying type. The bit representation is that the first component specified in the name of the format is in the most-significant bits and the last component specified is in the least-significant bits of the underlying type. The in-memory ordering of bytes comprising the underlying type is determined by the host endianness.\n\nOne must therefore be careful about endianness for packed representations when reading from an image.\n\nExtended help\n\nHere is an informative list of most mappings (the element type, where relevant, is omitted and represented as T):\n\nPACK8: -> UInt8\n\nRG\n\nPACK16: ->
