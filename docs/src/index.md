# Vulkan.jl

This package wraps the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) library and exposes high-level abstractions. It ranges from convenience abstractions that ease the manipulation of the API to opinionated abstractions with loss of functionality geared towards common uses.

It builds upon the core API provided by the [VulkanCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/VulkanCore.jl/) package.
