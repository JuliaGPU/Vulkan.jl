# Vulkan

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGPU/Vulkan.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGPU/Vulkan.jl)

Higher level interface for [VulkanCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/VulkanCore.jl). This is a work in progress and the current development takes place on branch [serenity4/vulkangen](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Vulkan.jl/tree/serenity4/vulkangen). This uses a procedural approach that auto-wraps the Vulkan API, taking advantage of its structure and its rigorous specification. Part of the code was inspired from a previous development on the branch [sd/highlevel](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Vulkan.jl/tree/sd/highlevel).
