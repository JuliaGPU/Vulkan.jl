# Introduction

Vulkan is a high-level compute and graphics specification, targeting a broad range of GPUs. Because it is only a specification, there does not exist only one Vulkan library, but rather multiple device-dependent implementations conforming to a unique standard. The version of the Vulkan implementation you are using therefore depends on the driver installed for your GPU.
