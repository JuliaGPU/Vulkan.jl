Almost every handle must be created and destroyed with API commands. Some handles have a parent handle (see Parent handle access for navigating through the resulting handle hierarchy), which must not be destroyed before its children. For this we provide wrappers around creation functions with an automatic finalization feature (see Automatic finalization) that uses a simple reference couting system. This alleviates the burden of tracking when a handle can be freed and freeing it, in conformance with the Vulkan specification. Most handles are typically created with a *CreateInfo or *AllocateInfo structure, that packs creation parameters to be provided to the API creation function. To allow for nice one-liners that don't involve long create info names, these create info parameters are exposed in the creation function, automatically building the create info structure for you.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/_types/","page":"Vulkan types","title":"Vulkan types","text":"tip: Tip\nHandle types have a constructor defined that wraps around the creation function and automatically unwrap the result (see Error handling).","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/_types/#Automatic-finalization","page":"Vulkan types","title":"Automatic finalization","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/_types/","page":"Vulkan types","title":"Vulkan types","text":"Handles can be created with the API functions vkCreate* and vkAllocate*, and most of them must be destroyed after use with a vkDestroy* or vkFree*.
